### Introduction

> The endgame of the Investment Research Association is to become an evergreen fund driven by research in the Web 3 field.
>
> We respect facts, guard against cognitive bias, and provide Buidler DAO with cognitive precipitation, professional voice and capital leverage.

### üõ∞Ô∏è Get involved

**Deeply reflect on Web 2 and think carefully about Web 3. **

The responsibility of the Investment Research Association is to enhance the awareness of all Buidlers, and at the same time give back to the society the overflowing awareness and accomplished projects. We fight against the FOMO mentality with a clear-cut banner, and solidly accumulate awareness, incubate projects, and look for opportunities for Buidler DAO.

We welcome writing from scratch, and encourage submissions of past research,

In-depth research is accepted in the form of individuals and spontaneously established groups.
