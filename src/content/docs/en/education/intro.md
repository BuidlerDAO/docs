> When you see trees in the mountains, you know everything about its length; when you see grass in the wild, you know everything about its size. However, those who cannot cut down trees to make houses and gather grass to make prescriptions know that grass and trees cannot be used. ‚Äî‚Äî"Lunheng Chaoqi Thirty-ninth"

### Introduction

> üî¥ Wake up in your heart and say in your mouth that it is useless to do it on paper without learning it from yourself.
>
> We will build a high-quality, practice-oriented Web3 Deep Spring Academy, change thinking, and cultivate Web3 Buidlers.

### ‚ñ™Ô∏è Welcome to the school

**We prepare high-quality courses and believe that quality is far better than quantity; we invite big names to give speeches and respect the insights of Buidler in the industry;**

**We collect a profound collection of books and attach importance to a systematic reading experience; we translate Chinese and English originals, so that language is no longer a barrier to Web 3 knowledge. **
